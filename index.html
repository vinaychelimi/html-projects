    <p id="1">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
         such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
 and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides 
 a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
  lists, links, quotes, and other items. </p>

   <p id="3">HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. 
    Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML,Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
